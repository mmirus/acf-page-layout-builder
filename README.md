# TODO

* Should method of including template be changed? Currently, displaying site header / footer would require overriding template in theme for some themes. That may be acceptable.
* Break up aplb-base.php into partials
* Make base and partials overridable
* Refactor CSS
  * use grid to replace AFP spanN classes; remove extra wrappers where possible
  * use flexbox to align content at the bottom
